### Sub Tasks
* Team leader 0:
  - set up team resources (Slack, GitHub, Skype, etc),
  - documentation
  - coordination
  - testing
  - programming support
  - removing tabs
* Vince & William: waypoint updater a.k.a. getting the car moving at all.
  - making the car drive
  - making the car drive smoothly
  - making the car drive smoothly as long as we want
  - stopping the car when told that's a good idea
  - resuming the car when told that's a good idea
* Andreas & Markus: tl_detector, working on the classifier.
  - detecting the state of any visible traffic lights
  - deciding when a stop should be done based on traffic light state

## Project Components

### Nodes
![System Diagram](imgs/final-project-ros-graph-v2.png "System Diagram")

#### Perception
* Traffic light detection
* Obstacle detection

#### Planning
* Waypoint updater - Sets target velocity for each waypoint based on traffic light and obstacles.

#### Control
* Drive by wire ROS node -
  - input: target trajectory
  - output: control commands to vehicle
* Here's a handy flowchart for PID tuning.

### Car Info
* [ROS Interface to Lincoln MKZ DBW System](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/)
* throttle range = 0 to 1.0
* Official docs on brake value says: `...units of torque (N*m). The
  correct values for brake can be computed using the desired
  acceleration, weight of the vehicle, and wheel radius.`
* Carla is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_MKZ
  - Curb weight = 3,713-3,911 lb (1,684-1,774 kg)
  - `/dbw_node/vehicle_mass`: 1080.0
  - 726 g/L density of gas. 13.5gal=51.1Liters, max fuel mass=37.1kg
  - 4 passengers = 280 kg
  - Let's just say 2000kg for a deployed car.
* Decel_Force(newtons) = Mass_car(kg) * Max_decel(meter/s^2) 
* MaxBrakeTorque(newton * meter) = Decel_Force(newtons) * wheel_radius(meters) / 4 wheels
* MaxBrakeTorque(newton * meter) = Mass_car(kg) * Max_decel(meter/s^2) * wheel_radius(meters) / 4 wheels
* Wheel radius
  - `rospy.get_param('~wheel_radius', 0.2413)` but...
  - `/dbw_node/wheel_radius`: 0.335
  - Chris independently calculated the wheel radius to be .340m
  - ...so let's go with .335
* MaxBrakeTorque
  - (newton * meter) = 2000(kg) * 5(meter/s^2) * .335(meters) / 4 wheels
  - MaxBrakeTorque= 837.5Nm

### Explicit Requirements
* Code via GitHub
* README.md

## TODO
1. The Waypoint Updater Node seems to be a prerequisite to many other components
   so it is recommended to work on it first.
2. DBW (Drive By Wire) Node
3. Traffic Light Detection
4. Waypoint Updater Node - full functionality.

### Find Tabs To Eliminate

```
find . -iname '*py' | while read N; do echo "== $N"; grep $'\t' $N ; done
```

## Run

```
catkin_make && source devel/setup.sh && roslaunch launch/styx.launch
rosbag play -l just_traffic_light.bag
rqt_image_view /image_color
rqt_console
```

* _#p-system-integration_ - Seems to be where this project is being discussed.
* _#sdc-ros_ - ROS topics.
* [Discussion Forum - System Integration](https://discussions.udacity.com/c/nd013-system-integration)

## Interesting Chatter From Forums/Slack
Seems like this could go sideways easily. Let's be careful to double
check degrees/radians and get consistent.

> Seems that `waypoint_loader.py` is feeding degrees to
> `quaternion_from_euler` which expects radiansâ€¦ and `bridge.py` is
> feeding radians to `create_light` which expects degrees.

And in a similar theme...

5. Confirm that traffic light detection works on real life images
