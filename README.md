### Possible Division Of Labor
* Team leader 0:
  - set up team resources (Slack, GitHub, Skype, etc),
  - documentation
  - coordination
  - testing
  - programming support
* Vince & William: waypoint updater a.k.a. getting the car moving at all.
  - Hey guys, add your own details by modifying this section!
* Andreas & Markus: tl_detector, working on the classifier.
  - Hey guys, add your own details by modifying this section!

## Project Components

### Nodes
![System Diagram](imgs/final-project-ros-graph-v2.png "System Diagram")

#### Perception
* Traffic light detection
* Obstacle detection

#### Planning
* Waypoint updater - Sets target velocity for each waypoint based on traffic light and obstacles.

#### Control
* Drive by wire ROS node -
  - input: target trajectory
  - output: control commands to vehicle
* Here's a handy flowchart for PID tuning.

### Explicit Requirements
* Code via GitHub
* README.md

## TODO
1. The Waypoint Updater Node seems to be a prerequisite to many other components
   so it is recommended to work on it first.
2. DBW (Drive By Wire) Node
3. Traffic Light Detection
4. Waypoint Updater Node - full functionality.

### Notable Slack Channels
* _#p-system-integration_ - Seems to be where this project is being discussed.
* _#sdc-ros_ - ROS topics.
* [Discussion Forum - System Integration](https://discussions.udacity.com/c/nd013-system-integration)

## Interesting Chatter From Forums/Slack
Seems like this could go sideways easily. Let's be careful to double
check degrees/radians and get consistent.

> Seems that `waypoint_loader.py` is feeding degrees to
> `quaternion_from_euler` which expects radiansâ€¦ and `bridge.py` is
> feeding radians to `create_light` which expects degrees.

And in a similar theme...
